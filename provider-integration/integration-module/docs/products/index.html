        <h2>Payment model</h2>

        <p>
            The payment model of UCloud is fairly flexible, unfortunately with this, it also becomes a bit complex to 
            understand. In this section, we will attempt to guide you through choosing the right payment model for your
            product.
        </p>

        <h3>1) Is the product allocated on a quota basis? (<code>quota</code>)</h3>

        If the product is allocated on a quota basis of maximum concurrent usage, then the configuration is fairly
        simple and is always as shown below:

        <figure>
            <doc-snippet>
                cost:
                    quota: true
            </doc-snippet>

            <figcaption>
                A product which is using allocated based on maximum concurrent usage. We recommend that you only use 
                this for products such as <code>storage</code>, <code>ingress</code>, <code>licenses</code> and
                <code>publicIps</code>. We <i>do not</i> recommend that you use this for compute based products. For a
                compute based product this would translate into "a maximum number of concurrently active cores".
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>2) Which unit do you use for allocations? (<code>currency</code>)</h3>

        <p>
            This section is only used if <code>quota: false</code>. For all other 
            cases you must not supply this property.
        </p>

        <p>
            In UCloud, there are three types of allocations you can give your users:
        </p>

        <doc-table>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>

                    <td><code>DKK</code></td>
                    <td>
                        Using regular money (e.g. DKK or EUR). <br>
                        <b>Note (24/10/2022):</b> The only currency available is DKK at the moment. A future update 
                        will expand this.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>UNITS</code></td>
                    <td>A product specific unit (e.g. "<b>GB</b> days", "<b>Core</b> hours" or "<b>IP</b> minutes")</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>FREE</code></td>
                    <td>The product is always free to use and does not require further approval</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        </doc-table>

        <h3>3) How frequent are charges made and what is the lowest amount of use a user can be charged for? (<code>frequency</code>)</h3>

        <p>
            This section is only used if <code>quota: false</code>. For all other 
            cases you must not supply this property.
        </p>

        <doc-table>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>ONE_TIME</code></td>
                    <td>The resource is paid for only once and can be used for its entire duration/indefinitely.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>MINUTE</code></td>
                    <td>The user pays for the amount of time the resource is used. The lowest charge is for a single minute.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>HOUR</code></td>
                    <td>The user pays for the amount of time the resource is used. The lowest charge is for a single hour.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>DAY</code></td>
                    <td>The user pays for the amount of time the resource is used. The lowest charge is for a single day.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        </doc-table>

        <h3>4) What is the price? (<code>price</code>)</h3>

        <p>
            This section is only used if <code>quota: false</code> and <code>currency: DKK</code>. For all other 
            cases you must not supply this property. This property must contain a decimal value which is the price for
            a single period (see <code>frequency</code>) of use. Note that UCloud/Core has limited precision and will 
            reject your request if it is unable to precisely represent your price. For extremely cheap products, you may
            need to adjust the <code>frequency</code> in order to precisely represent your price.
