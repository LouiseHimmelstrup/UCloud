# Applications: License Service

This service provides a primitive license component to be used by applications. License servers can be provided to an 
application run via a widget (see [here](../app-store-service/wiki/apps.md)).

To better understand this service we suggest the following starting points:

- [LicenseServer](./wiki/api/dk.sdu.cloud.app.license.api/-license-server/index.md): The core abstraction of this 
  service
- [updateAcl](./wiki/api/dk.sdu.cloud.app.license.api/-app-license-descriptions/update-acl.md): Access to license 
  servers are managed through ACLs.
