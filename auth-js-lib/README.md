# auth-js-lib

Small utility library for _web-frontends_ to deal with authentication tokens.

## THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A BACKEND LIBRARY

It will _NOT_ verify that _any_ tokens are created by the correct services. It will blindly
trust tokens and delegate that responsibility to the backend servers.
