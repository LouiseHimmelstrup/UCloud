 * _Interacts_ with a UCloud resource, typically causing an update to the resource itself.
 *
 * RPCs in this category must accept request payloads in the form of a

 *
 * This category of calls can be used for any type of interaction with a UCloud resource. Many resources in UCloud
 * are represented by some underlying complex logic. As a result, it is typically not meaningful or possible to simple
 * patch the resource's data model directly. Instead, clients must _interact_ with the resources to change them.
 *
 * For example, if a client wishes to suspend a virtual machine, they would not send back a new representation of the
 * virtual machine stating that it is suspended. Instead, clients should send a `suspend` interaction. This instructs
 * the backend services to correctly initiate suspend procedures.
 *
 * All update operations have a name associated with them. Names should clearly indicate which underlying procedure
 * will be triggered by the RPC. For example, suspending a virtual machine would likely be called `suspend`.
 *
 * On HTTP this will apply the following routing logic:
 *
 * - Method: `POST` (_always_)

There are two exceptions to this rule:

1. Certain calls may choose to only guarantee this at the provider level. That is if a single call contain request
for multiple providers, then in rare occasions (i.e. crash) changes might not be rolled back immediately on all
providers. A service _MUST_ attempt to rollback already committed changes at other providers.

2. The underlying system does not provide such guarantees. In this case the service/provider _MUST_ support the
verification API to cleanup these resources later.
