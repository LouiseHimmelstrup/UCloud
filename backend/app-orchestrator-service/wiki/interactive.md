# Interactive Applications

Some `Application`s are of an interactive nature, which require additional input from the user after the `Job` has
entered its `RUNNING` state. These typically include the `WEB` and `VNC` type applications.

UCloud provides a way for users to open an interactive session to UCloud. See `jobs.openInteractiveSession` (TODO Inline
docs).
