SDU eScience Terms of Service
=============================

*Version 1.3*

*Last modified: 3 December 2020*

## SDU eScience Service Agreement

This SDU eScience Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer").

This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks to accept the Agreement (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click to accept. This Agreement governs Customer's access to and use of the Service.

### 1. **Provision of the Services**

1.1 **Services Use.** Subject to this Agreement, during the Term, Customer may: (a) use the Services, (b) integrate the Services into any Application that has material value independent of the Services, and (c) use any Software provided by SDU eScience as part of the Services. Customer may not sublicense or transfer these rights except as permitted under the Assignment section of the Agreement.

1.2 **Facilities.**  All facilities used to store and process an Application and Customer Data will adhere to Best Practice security standards.

1.3 **Data Location.** Customer Data will be stored at the SDU eScience data center. By using the Services, Customer consents to this storage of Customer Data.

1.4 **Accounts.** Customer must have an Account and a Token (if applicable) to use the Services, and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of the Token and its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account and the Token. If Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its password, its Account or the Token, Customer will notify SDU eScience as promptly as possible. SDU eScience has no obligation to provide Customer multiple Tokens or Accounts.

1.5 **New Applications and Services.** SDU eScience may: (i) make new applications, tools, features or functionality available from time to time through the Services and (ii) add new services to the "Services" definition from time to time (by adding them at the URL set forth under that definition), the use of which may be contingent upon Customer's agreement to additional terms.

1.6 **Modifications.**

a. **To the Services.** SDU eScience may make reasonable updates to the Services from time to time. If SDU eScience makes a material change to the Services, SDU eScience will inform Customer.

b. **To the Agreement.** SDU eScience may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing (and any linked documents) from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by SDU eScience, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. SDU eScience will provide at least 90 days' advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by either: (i) sending an email to Customer's primary point of contact; (ii) posting a notice in the Services' notification systems if applicable; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, please stop using the Services. SDU eScience will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.

c. **To the Data Processing and Security Terms.** SDU eScience may only change the Data Processing and Security Terms where such change is required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, court order, or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency, where such change is expressly permitted by the Data Processing and Security Terms, or where such change:

(i) does not result in a degradation of the overall security of the Services;

(ii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on SDU eScience's processing of Customer Personal Data, as described in Section 5.2 (Scope of Processing) of the Data Processing and Security Terms; and

(iii) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer's rights under the Data Processing and Security Terms.

If SDU eScience makes a material change to the Data Processing and Security Terms in accordance with this Section, SDU eScience will post the modification to the URL containing those terms.

1.7 **Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms.** The Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms are incorporated by this reference into the Agreement.

### 2. **Payment Terms**

2.1 **Free Quota.** Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold, as applicable.

2.2 **Online Billing.** At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period, SDU eScience will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on (i) Customer's use of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period (including, if any, the relevant Fee for TSS set forth in the Fees definition below); (ii) any Reserved Units selected; (iii) any Committed Purchases selected; and/or (iv) any Package Purchases selected. For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set in the Account and will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. SDU eScience's measurement of Customer's use of the Services is final. SDU eScience has no obligation to provide multiple bills.

2.3 **Invoice Disputes & Refunds.** Any invoice disputes must be submitted prior to the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to SDU eScience, SDU eScience will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, SDU eScience will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of SDU eScience and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates SDU eScience to extend credit to any party.

2.4 **Delinquent Payments; Suspension.** Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by SDU eScience in collecting such delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the Services, SDU eScience may Suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach pursuant to Section 9.2.

2.5 **No Purchase Order Number Required.** For clarity, Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for SDU eScience to provide a purchase order number on SDU eScience's invoice (or otherwise).

### 3. **Customer Obligations**

3.1 **Compliance.** Customer will (a) ensure that Customer and its End Users' use of the Services complies with the Agreement, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, and (c) promptly notify SDU eScience Center of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, Account, or Customer's password of which Customer becomes aware. SDU eScience Center reserves the right to investigate any potential violation of the AUP by Customer, which may include reviewing Customer Applications, Customer Data, or Projects.
