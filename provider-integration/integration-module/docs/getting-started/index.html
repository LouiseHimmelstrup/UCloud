        <h2>Goal of this guide</h2>
        <p>
            In this guide, we will guide you through how to run your own local UCloud instance and connecting an example
            provider to it. We will explain some of the relevant concepts, which are also needed when you intend to run
            a production ready provider.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have never used UCloud before, then we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with some of 
            the basics. You can find a number of video demonstrations 
            <a href="https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/tutorials/tutorial1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

        <h2>Preparing your machine</h2>

        <p>
            The following is required of your local machine:

            <ul>
                <li>Your machine should run a recent version of either Linux or macOS</li>
                <li>You must have <code>docker</code> and docker compose installed</li>
                <li>You must be able to use <code>docker</code> from the command-line without sudo privileges</li>
                <li>You must have <code>git</code>installed</li>
                <li>You must have <code>javac</code> installed (<a href="https://sdkman.io/" target="_blank">SDKMAN</a> is a useful tool for installing Java)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            You should now clone the UCloud repository:

            <doc-snippet>
                git clone https://github.com/sdu-escience/ucloud.git
            </doc-snippet>
        </p>

        <h2>Installing and running UCloud</h2>

        <p>
            From the repository, start the <code>launcher</code> application:

            <doc-snippet>
                cd ucloud
                ./launcher
            </doc-snippet>
        </p>

        <p>
            This application will guide you through the installation of UCloud and get you up and running. Once UCloud
            has started, make sure to select the "Create provider..." item and install one of the providers. The
            Kubernetes provider is a good first choice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below you can see a demonstration of how to use the launcher tool to install UCloud and the Kubernetes
            provider.
        </p>

                Note: The video shows the full duration, including quite a lot of compilation time. You might want to 
                skip those parts of the video (00:20 until 03:55).
            </i>
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding what the launcher tool does</h2>

        <p>
            The <code>./launcher</code> is a tool for installing UCloud for use in evaluation and development.
            It will perform all the basic configuration and installation of all the components involved. This gives you
            a functional system which you can explore and tweak with.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first section of the demonstration (until 04:00) UCloud/Core along with its dependencies are
            installed. This leaves you with a fully function UCloud/Core system. However, UCloud/Core is itself not very
            useful without any providers. All you can do in UCloud at this point is login, change your avatar and invite
            a few friends to your project. But, you cannot consume any resources. All resources, regardless of type,
            are in one way or another implemented by a provider. 
        </p>

        <p>
            From 04:00 in the video, we create a Kubernetes provider. The exact same steps apply for any other 
            provider type. This installation goes through quite a lot of steps, which we will try to summarize here:

            <ol class="launcher-steps">
                <li>
                    A Kubernetes cluster is installed and started
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production env: This is your existing system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A "server" is provisioned for the integration module and configured to use the K8 cluster
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production env: This is the server you control which runs the IM. For example: an HPC frontend.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The launcher registers the provider with UCloud/Core. This produces a refresh token for the provider 
                    and a unique public key which UCloud/Core will use for all of its communication with the provider.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production env: This is done by a UCloud administrator. Keys are securely exchanged 
                            between UCloud admin and provider.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The IM server install the tokens, keys and relevant configuration
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production env: This takes place on the server running UCloud/IM. The rest of the 
                            documentation explains how this process works.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The integration module starts and connects to UCloud/Core</li>
                <li>
                    The launcher initiates registration of the provider's product catalog
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production env: You can do this with <code>ucloud products register</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The provider is restarted
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production env: This step is important, without it, UCloud/IM will not be able to use the 
                            products.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A grant allocator is provisioned and given initial resources for the new provider
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production env: A UCloud administrator will do this for you based on your instructions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Launcher troubleshooting</h2>

        <p>
            In case something goes wrong, the following troubleshooting steps can be useful to reset your environment:

            <ul>
                <li>Try to delete the <code>.compose/$envName</code> and <code>.compose/current.txt</code> from your local repository</li>
                <li>If using the remote option, try to delete the <code>ucloud</code> folder from the remote machine</li>
                <li>Try to delete the <code>.compose</code> folder from your local repository</li>
                <li>Manually look for docker volumes (<code>docker volume ls</code>) and docker containers (<code>docker ps -a</code>) and remove any which start with your environment name.</li>
                <li>Remove the local repository and clone it again</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Next steps</h2>

        <p>
            The remainder of this documentation will explore the different configuration files that UCloud/IM has.
            It explains in detail how the different plugins affect UCloud/IM's functionality and how the different
            pieces work.
        </p>

        <p>
            We recommend that you initially skim through the different configuration sections and then pick one of the
            tutorials from the sidebar which are relevant for you.
