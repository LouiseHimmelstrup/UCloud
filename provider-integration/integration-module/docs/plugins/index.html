        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>

            The purpose of a plugin is to handle the integration between UCloud and your system. As you configure
            UCloud/IM you will install plugins for all aspects of the integration. For example, you can tell the
            UCloud/IM how to connect to your file-system or how to handle user creation. At the top level, the
            configuration file contains a section for each type of plugin. It looks roughly like this:

        </p>

        <figure>
            <pre><code>connection:                         # What happens when a user clicks "Connect"?
    type: ---

projects:                           # How should the provider deal with project management?
    type: ---

jobs:                               # What should happen when a computational job is started?
    normalQueue:
        type: ---
        matches: ---
    fancyQueue:
        type: ---
        matches: ---

files:                              # How should UCloud/IM connect to your file system?  
    default:
        type: ---
        matches: ---

fileCollections:                    # ...and which files are relevant to the end-user?
    default:
        type: ---
        matches: ---</code></pre>
            <figcaption>The general outline for the plugins configuration file</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            You might notice from the snippet above, that there exists roughly two types of plugins:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Singletons (e.g. connection and projects)</li>
            <li>Product based (e.g. jobs, files and fileCollections)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>

            Plugin types which are singletons can run in at most one copy in your system. For example, it is only
            possible to register a single plugin for user connections. These plugins always defines which
            implementation to use via the type property. Any remaining configuration is then dependent on which
            implementation you are using.

        </p>

        <figure>
            <pre><code>connection:                         # Plugin type
    type: OpenIdConnect             # Plugin implementation 
    endpoints: { ... }              # Implementation-dependent configuration</code></pre>
            <figcaption>An example of a singleton based plugin</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>

            It is a similar story for plugin types which are product based. However, you can select different
            implementations based on the product. These sections always start out by defining a plugin instantiation.
            This instantiation has a name, a plugin implementation. But they also have a property which matches a
            product set. This matcher is, in most circumstances, equal to the name of a product category. But you can
            also use the special value of "*". This value will select any product which is not selected by some other
            matcher.

        </p>

        <figure>
            <pre><code>jobs:                               # Plugin type

    normalQueue:                    # Instantiation name 
        type: Slurm                 # Plugin implementation
        matches: "normal-machines"  # Product matcher (matches products in "normal-machines")
        partition: normal           # Implementation-dependent configuration

    fancyQueue:
        type: Slurm
        matches: "*"                # Matches any product which is not matched by any other 
                                    # matcher. In this case, it means any product not in 
                                    # "normal-machines"
        partition: fancy
                </code></pre>

    <h2>Configuration sections</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Connections (<code>connections</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/connections.html">Connections</a></p>

        <p>
            Connections are used to handle what happens when a user clicks on the "Connect" button after they have
            received an allocation for your provider. This forms the foundation of the user-mapping between UCloud
            identities and your local identities.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Projects (<code>projects</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/projects.html">Projects</a></p>

        <p>
            A project plugin is responsible for synchronizing UCloud projects into your system. For a traditional
            HPC system, this might create corresponding UNIX groups and synchronize members into these groups as
            they are added and removed from the project.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Computational jobs (<code>jobs</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/jobs.html">Jobs</a></p>

        <p>
            A job plugin is responsible for anything related to starting, managing and interacting with
            computational jobs. Plugins of this type can do anything from scheduling a batch job, to creating a
            virtual machine. This type of plugin typically works in tandem with a storage plugin. Some compute
            plugins might even require you to use a specific storage plugin with it.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Storage (<code>files, fileCollections</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/fileCollections.html">File collections</a> and <a
                href="/plugins/files.html">Files</a></p>

        <p>
            Storage plugins define how to access your data. This data is typically consumed by a compute plugin.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Public links (<code>ingresses</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/ingresses.html">Ingresses</a></p>

        <p>
            Public link plugins give your computational jobs a way to attach a public link (typically exposed as
            either an HTTP virtual host or a DNS name). Public links plugins typically require you to use a
            specific computational plugin.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Public IPs (<code>publicIps</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/publicIps.html">Public IPs</a></p>

        <p>
            Public IP plugins allow you to expose IPs as a resource. These IP addresses are are often consumed by
            a jobs plugin.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Licenses (<code>licenses</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/licenses.html">Licenses</a></p>

        <p>
            License plugins are used in tandem with jobs plugins to grant access to licensed software.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Shared files (<code>shares</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/shares.html">Shares</a></p>

        <p>
            A shares plugin define how to create shared files between two UCloud users. This plugin type is
            generally discouraged and you should prefer collaboration through projects.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Resource allocations (<code>allocations</code>)</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: </i> <a href="/plugins/allocations.html">Allocations</a></p>

        <p>
            An allocation plugin allows you to specify which actions should occur when a resource allocation is
            granted to a UCloud workspace.
