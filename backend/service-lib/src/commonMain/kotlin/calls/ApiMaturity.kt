/**
 * Reserved for internal APIs, provides no guarantees wrt. stability
 *
 * External clients should avoid these calls as they may change with no notice. We will not provide any guidance or
 * migration path for this type of API. There are several levels of internal APIs:
 *
 * - __Beta:__
 *     - Breaking changes can be made quickly (with no real deprecation cycle)
 *     - Documentation is optional
 * - __Stable:__
 *     - Documentation is mandatory
 *     - Breaking changes should be made with a deprecation cycle lasting two versions
 *     - Note: The deprecation cycle is only there to allow for rolling upgrades
 *     - The two versions participating in the deprecation cycle could be rolled out very quickly (less than one day is
 *       perfectly okay)

/**
 * Used for APIs which are maturing into a stable state, provides some guarantees wrt. stability
 *
 * APIs of this type are expected to be consumed by external clients but has not yet reached a mature level. This
 * means we will still be changing this API rather frequently as needed.
 * There are several levels of experimental APIs:
 *
 * - __Alpha:__
 *     - Feature complete according to initial design
 *     - Breaking changes are made when needed
 *     - No migration path or deprecation cycle
 *     - Documentation is optional
 * - __Beta:__
 *     - Feature complete
 *     - User feedback is heavily encouraged during this phase
 *     - Breaking changes are generally only done if feedback suggests that this is needed
 *     - Short deprecation period if deemed necessary
 *     - Documentation is mandatory
 *
 * External clients are encouraged to use beta-level APIs and to try out alpha-level APIs.

/**
 * Used for mature and stable APIs, provides strong guarantees wrt. stability
 *
 * A stable API is considered done and will require a deprecation cycle for any breaking change to be made. The only
 * exception to this rule is if the change is required for security reasons. See below for a definition of a breaking
 * change. Stable APIs must be documented.
 *
 * The deprecation cycle is as follows:
 *
 *   1. Mark the API with `@Deprecated`
 *   2. Implement a replacement (if relevant)
 *   3. Develop a migration path and announce removal date
 *     - Note: This is a a rough time-frame, will not be removed earlier than announced
 *     - Note: Migration path and removal date will be released at least 6 months before removal of old API
 *   4. No earlier than announced removal date, remove the functionality
 *
 * Note: Security patches do not follow the deprecation cycle. Instead,
 * security patches are released as quickly as possible. Migration paths,
 * if needed, will be released later.
 *
 * ## Definition of a breaking change
 *
 * Breaking changes can be considered in different contexts, these are as follows:
 *
 * - Source code compatibility (Kotlin `api` module)
 * - Binary code compatibility (Kotlin `api` module)
 * - Network-level compatibility
 *
 * For the time being we will only consider network-level compatibility.
 * In the future we might consider source code compatibility and binary code
 * compatibility.
 *
 * The contract of an API is defined by its documentation.
 *
 * A UCloud API is backwards compatible at the network-level if:
 *
 * - A valid request payload of a previous version is still supported in the new version
 * - Fields which were mandatory in a previous version are still mandatory and returned. In other words, the API must
 *   return a super-set of the previous response payload.
 * - The API follows the same contract as the previous version
 *
 * This means that the following is not considered a breaking change:
 *
 * - Adding an optional field anywhere in the response payload
 *   - Developer note: be careful with types which are used as part of request
 *   and response
 * - Adding an optional field anywhere in the request payload
 * - Marking an optional field anywhere in the response payload as mandatory
 * - Any change which changes the implementation while still conforming to the contract
 * - Clarifying the API contract
 *
 * The following is considered a breaking change:
 *
 * - Marking a mandatory field in the response payload as optional
 * - Marking an optional field anywhere in the request payload as mandatory
 * - Changing the API contract
